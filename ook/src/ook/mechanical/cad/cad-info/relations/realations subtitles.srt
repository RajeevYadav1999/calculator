1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,866
Relations are used to restrict the degree of freedom
It is also known as constraints.

2
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:18,199
Those entities are not having relation can be free move in any direction

3
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:25,132
When we add relation the entity can not be move in another direction

4
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:33,566
For add any realtion  right click on entity then pop up appears and select the  required relation or we select it from the feature manager

5
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:14,733
we want horizontal line  but the line drawn is not horizontal simply add horizontal relation the line become automatically horizontal

6
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:18,733
 for adding horiztontal constraint so right click on it pop up will apear and select the horizontal relation 

7
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:23,599
Or you can also select it from the line properties in the feature manager

8
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:35,532
when we want vertical line  but the line drawn is not vertical so right click on it pop up will apear and select the vertical relation 

9
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:46,499
If we want parallel lines but the line are not parallel  press and hold ctrl key in keyboard first select the line along 

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:55,800
which we want to parallel the another lines and then select the anothe lines after that we have to select the realation from the pop up or from the line properties

11
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:05,900
for perpendicular relation press and hold ctrl key and select the lines a pop up will appear and select or you can also slect it from the line properties

12
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:12,866
we can also appply relations with the help of helping 

13
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:18,999
line helping lines are yellow colour lines which help us to make an entity with relation

14
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,666
for applying collinear relation press and hold ctrl key select the entities 

15
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,066
after selecting entities select the collinear relation from the line properties in featur manager

16
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:58,499
when we want to equal lines press and hold ctrl key and select lines and also select the equal relation from the pop up or  line properties

17
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:22,066
for applying tangent relation press and hold ctrl key select the circle and also select the line where we want to tangent 

18
00:04:41,433 --> 00:05:02,933
coincide relation are used to connect two entities for applying it press and hold ctrl key select the entities and select it from pop up or from linr properties

19
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:19,799
midoint relation are used to connect two entities from the midpoint of one entity for applying it press and hold ctrl key select the entities and select it from pop up or from line properties
